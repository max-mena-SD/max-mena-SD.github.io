# Max's Passion for Software Engineering

Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Max and I am a passionate computer engineer in constant search for creative and efficient solutions. This repository is a summary of my work experience and an idea to return to using ASP.NET and MVC, the idea is to apply various technologies and continue building on this same project.

## Project description

This is a project developed with .NET core and C#, using the Model View Controller, simple but looking to prove a concept.

## Repository Content

- **ASP.NET:** Web development framework developed by Microsoft.
- **Contact Form:** At the moment it is a concept but it seeks to put into practice the sending of information.
- **BootStrap:** Framework for styling a website.

Happy coding! ðŸ’»âœ¨
